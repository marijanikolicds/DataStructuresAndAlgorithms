## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. 
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
This project has resulted from my preparations for the interviews for the SWE at Google. 
Hope that it will help you land a job at your dream company.

## File Descriptions
This project contains Python implementation of elementary data structures, sorting, searching, graph- and string-processing algorithms.

### Data Structures
* Union Find
* Lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Bags
* Heaps
* Binary Trees
* N-ary Trees
* Binary Search Trees
* Interval Trees
* Segment Trees
* Tries

### Sorting

### Graph-processing algorithms

### String-processing algorithms

## Results
Some of the topics are discussed in the posts [here](https://medium.com/@marija.e2/).


Feel free to use the code here as you would like!
